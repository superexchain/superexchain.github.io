# Node Overview

## RPC Node

An RPC node is an RPC service provider that offers public RPC endpoints for developers to use. SCS Chain currently maintains a public node that anyone can use for free. However, participants are encouraged to run their own RPC nodes and provide RPC services.

## Network Types

There are several different networks on which a node can operate. Each network has its own independent validators and unique state.
